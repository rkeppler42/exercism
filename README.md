# 🏋️ Exercism Practice

A collection of my solutions to [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) exercises across multiple programming languages.  
Each exercise folder contains **only my latest solution** as it appears on my Exercism profile.  
I regularly refactor and improve my solutions, but only the **final version** for each exercise is stored here.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language:

```
exercism/
├── python/
│ ├── hello-world/
│ │ └── hello_world.py
│ └── two-fer/
│ └── two_fer.py
├── csharp/
│ ├── HelloWorld/
│ │ └── HelloWorld.cs
│ └── TwoFer/
│ └── TwoFer.cs
└── javascript/
├── hello-world/
│ └── helloWorld.js
└── two-fer/
└── twoFer.js
```



- **One folder per exercise.**  
- **One file per folder** containing the **latest solution**.  
- Historical iterations and refactors remain only on **Exercism**, not in this repo.

## 🚀 Goals of this Repository

- Track my progress across multiple programming languages.  
- Keep a public record of my **most up-to-date solutions**.  
- Show my approach to problem-solving and clean code practices.
